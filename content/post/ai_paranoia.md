<b><font color="#251F68" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AI Breakout</font></b> refers to the act of an intelligent machine escaping from the limits imposed by the human beings. 
<br><br>
For a quick context, <b>Reinforcement Learning</b> is a goal-oriented learning for machines based on its interaction with the environment. The aim is to maximize a certain reward (like best stock exchange options for the year, maximum number of wins in a game etc).
<br>

On an internet-connected computer, running a <b>reinforcement-learning based AI</b> is a risky proposition. <br>
This is because we have no way of fully understanding what it would do and what it wouldnâ€™t, for instance <font color="#251F68">it may virally just spread itself online</font>, which would mean a total loss of control. <br>
Once it spreads itself on the web, its close to impossible to restrict the choices that the AI wants to make.

<b>There are some suggested precautions to prevent this kind of breakout:</b>
<ul>
	<li> Run the AI only inside a virtual machine</li>
    <li> Strip off all the bells and whistles that we usually associate with computers: if possible, no keyboard, no monitor, no loudspeaker, no internet connectivity, nothing! </li>
<li>Limit the life-span of untrusted AI-written code </li>
    <ul><li> Run tasks in independent batches </li>
    <li> Clear the entire memory content and reinstall program from scratch after each execution, hence preventing the machine from learning over time </li> </ul>
</ul>
</p>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the above cannot be applicable to <b>graphics-heavy systems / games</b> as they require full access to the hardware of the user. Probably, AI games companies run the highest risk of breakout of a super-intelligent AI.
