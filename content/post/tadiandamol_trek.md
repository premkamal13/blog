When I looked at the clouds, the confusion was still there,<br>
but there was a little more of calm than the exasperations.
<br><br>
Dropping all my options in the void below, my head felt a bit light,<br>
'coz with every recourse, went away so much of stew from the sight.
<br><br>
When the worries passed out, sitting there was an empty bowl of me,<br>
To fill it back just right this time, descended a nature-nurtured free.
