<b><font color="#251F68" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Technological singularity</font></b> is the hypothesis that the invention of artificial super intelligence <font color="#251F68">( ASI )</font> will abruptly trigger runaway technological growth, resulting in enigmatic changes to human civilization.

According to this hypothesis, an <b>upgradable intelligent agent</b> (<font color="#251F68">such as a computer running software-based artificial general intelligence</font>) would enter a <b>"runaway reaction of self-improvement cycles"</b> (by cascading the gathered knowledge to the next version of itself). 
With each new and more intelligent generation appearing more and more rapidly, an <b>intelligence explosion</b> will happen resulting in a <font color="#251F68">powerful superintelligence </font> that would, qualitatively, far surpass all human intelligence.
<br>

<br>Most people find Singularity scary and that as we won't know what we are dealing with, it might lead to human destruction even by a simple mistake.<br>
<font color="#251F68">
However, there are many who believe that it is likely to transform the world into <b>a far better place</b> than it is now by working with the humans.</font>

<b>Top scientists predict that singularity will happen by next 30 years!</b><br>
<ul>
<li> MIT’s Patrick Winston puts the predicted singularity time as <b>2040</b> </li>
<li> Ray Kurzweil, Google’s Director of Engineering says it will happen by <b>2045</b> </li>
<li> Louis Rosenberg, CEO of Unanimous AI, claims it will arrive by <b>2030</b> </li>
<li> Jürgen Schmidhuber (Chief Scientist at AI company NNAISENSE) claims it to happen by <b>2048</b> </li>
<li> Han, an AI bot predicted the singularity to happen by <b>2029</b></li>
