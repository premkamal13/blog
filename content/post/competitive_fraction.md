**What is it?**

There is a fraction of competitiveness inside every individual, if you opened this article, i think you do as well. 
Its not necessarily a bad thing. In a few cases, this feeling decides how people will move forward in life. Well, I am one of those typical weirdoes. Majority of my decisions are motivated by a competitive spirit. I wanna be better, not because maybe I can, but because i have to.

So, who do I compete with? May be a friend, may be a foe. Maybe someone, who is better in eyes of someone I care about or maybe the person I care about. Actually, the answer is whoever gains my attention and I think in some ways he is better than me.

How did this begin? I don’t know. But I remember having that spark from as long as I can remember - the childhood games that I played, the little inter-house competitions held at school and even a mark less that I got in my subjects of interest.

**An old story…**

I can recall an incident that relates to the title.
I was in class IV, when some assignment was given the class. I worked hard to complete it. A good friend of mine asked me to let him copy mine for he had forgotten to complete it at home. Well, he copied it and yeah, I was happy to help, all good. 

But something changed afterwards. When our copies returned after being signed, the copy was marked A+ and mine an A. I was not happy about it. I was agitated, there was no difference in the work, no? Why the hell did the teacher mark me a grade less than him. I borrowed his copy and looked at both of them for quite a while. This time I got it. There was one. His handwriting was actually much more appealing than mine. I kept the copy back in my bag with a silent promise to myself. I was going to get better. 

That is my first memory when that competitive fraction got the best out of me. I remembered that incident and I practiced improving my handwriting most of the time. I was more bothered about my handwriting than all my work. Slowly, I began to get better, more curvy, smooth, round and tiny-bit better with every next page that I wrote. 

One day, I got a comment from the same teacher, your handwriting is getting really good. Well, I said thanks but I said that wasn’t enough. It might be a matter of days, when one day, she took my copy and showed it to the whole class as the sample of awesome handwritten sample. There I was, holding up my end of bargain, I made with myself. Now, it was not anymore about that handwriting.

**But lets be vary of what it is not?**
