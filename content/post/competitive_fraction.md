**What Competitive Fraction am I talking about?**

The fraction of competitiveness against any rival (be it self) that rests inside every individual.

What affect that fraction has on you depends majorly on :

1. the direction you can channel it to &

2. the control you can practice on it

In a few cases, this feeling decides how you will move forward in life. 


<p> <font color = "#552525">I am one of those common people. Majority of my decisions are motivated by a competitive spirit. </br>I wanna be better, not because I can, but because i have to. </font></p>

**So, who do I compete with?**

May be a friend, may be a foe. Maybe someone, who is better in eyes of someone I care about or maybe the person I care about. Actually, the answer is whoever gains my attention and I wish to chase the ways he is better than me (that happens in a good number of cases). 

In absence of the above, its the prior best-self.

How did this begin? I donâ€™t know. But I remember having that somewhere within from as long as I can remember - in the childhood games that I played, in the little inter-house competitions held at school and when I got even a mark less that in my subjects of my interest.

**There is an old story embedded in my head.**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="/cf_assignment.jpeg" alt="Drawing" style="height: 50px;"/>

I was in class IV, when an essay assignment was given in the Hindi class. I worked hard to complete that long essay (hard for the drifter, that I was). A good friend of mine asked me to let him copy mine for he had forgotten to complete it at home. Well, he copied it and yeah, I was happy to help, all good. 

But something changed afterwards. When our copies returned after being graded, my friend's article was marked an **A+** and mine an **A**.

<font color = "#552525">I went through so much in the moment:<br><ul> <li> heart-broken by the injustice of the teacher</li> <li>betrayal by a friend who I helped & </li> <li>wrath for the unfair world.</li></font> </ul><br>
<br>

<br>
<br>" <font color = "#552525"><i>There was no difference in our essays, no? 
</br>Why would the teacher mark me a grade less than him? </i>" </font><br> <br>
</p>I borrowed the graceful copy from my friend and looked at both the copies for a while. It took me some time but I got the difference. <br>
After the shades of anger faded away, i knew inside why my friend was a clear winner. 
<br>

His **handwriting** was actually much more appealing than mine. I kept the copy back in my bag with a silent promise to get better. <br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="/cf_handwriting.jpg" alt="Drawing" style="height: 200px;"/><br><br>
<br>
That is the first strong memory of competitive fraction that rested in me. I remembered that incident and I practiced improving my handwriting most of the time. I always used to get some handwriting assignments from my Dad but this time, it was serious. <br>I was more bothered about my handwriting than completion of the task. Slowly, I began to get better, more curvy, smooth, round and tiny-bit better with every 5 pages that I wrote. 

One day, I got a comment from the same teacher, "<font color = "#228B22">your handwriting is so pretty</font>". I was happy, I thanked her for its recognition but now I had started enjoying this improvement. <br>
After few days, she took my copy and showed it to the whole class as the sample of <font color = "#228B22"><b>a beautiful piece of handwriting</b></font>. 


Done, that appreciation surpassed all the spite and I had a much better handwriting now! <br>A total win-win at the end of the small episode!

After all the good that it does, its just important to keep in head, **when it goes wrong?**
